Project 3
CSCI 360

You can find the pc value at the very top of my Project3.cpp in the Project3 constructor.
I tested my robot on a few of the environments that you described. My robot follows the shortest path when pc=1.0 and gets
more and more timid as the pc goes down. I named him TIM because he's pretty timid.
